# indexr

### An advanced image viewing app that allows user to custom tag their localally stored images. User can search by tags (or exclude by tag) to quickly find the image they were thinking of

## Technologies Used

### 
Postgresql datatbase
Ruby/Rails 
React (create-react-app)
Javascript (localstorage)

## New technologies
This project relies on parsing a user's local directory to find images (with a stretch goal to automatically parse sub-directories as well). This will involve learning some Web API's (like [FileSystemDirectoryEntry] (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FileSystemDirectoryEntry/createReader))
